👋 Welcome to my page!

Hi, I’m Hemanth Rama Kumar Garre —  

a data engineer working at the intersection of AI and data platforms,
focused on building scalable, cost-efficient systems that support
production-grade machine learning and analytics.


### 🧠 How I think about AI & Data

- **AI systems** are only as strong as the data platforms that support them
- **Reliable, well-modeled** data matters more than complex models
- **Performance and cost efficiency** are first-class concerns in production AI
- **Scalable data foundations** turn machine learning experiments into real business value


### ⚙️ Core Tech Stack 

My core stack exists to make data consistent, clean, and up to date, so that
machine learning models can work reliably in production.

- **SQL** – data modeling and consistency at scale  
- **Python** – data processing, automation, and ML workflows  
- **Snowflake** – scalable, performant data backbone for analytics and ML  
- **dbt** – trusted transformations and feature-ready data models  
- **Azure Data Factory** – ingestion and orchestration of reliable data pipelines
